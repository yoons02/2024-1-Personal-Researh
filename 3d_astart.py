import numpy as np

# Create a 15x15x15 array filled with zeros
array_3d = np.zeros((15, 15, 15))

# Optionally, you can fill the array with specific values
# For example, to fill it with random integers between 0 and 9:
# array_3d = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(15, 15, 15))

# Print the array
print(array_3d)
